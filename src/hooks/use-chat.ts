The \"Family Home Near School\" in Banilad might also interest you. It's for sale at ₱5,200,000 and offers 3 bedrooms, a garden, and is located in a quiet area near schools.\n\nWould you like more details about either of these properties?",

High rental demand potentially offers consistent rental income.\n- Cons: Monthly rent of ₱35,000 is on the higher end, which might limit your tenant pool.\n- ROI: Typically, condos in IT Park can yield 5-7% annual returns through rental income. Property value appreciation is estimated at 3-5% annually due to the developing commercial area.\n\n**Family Home in Banilad (Sale)**\n- Pros: Banilad is a prime residential area with good appreciation potential. The proximity to schools makes it attractive to families, ensuring stable demand.\n- Cons: Higher initial capital investment at ₱5,200,000.\n- ROI: If used as a rental, you might expect 4-6% annual returns. Property value appreciation could be 4-7% annually due to the established neighborhood and amenities.\n\nRecommendation:\n- Short-term investment: The luxury condo offers quicker returns through monthly rental income with less initial capital.\n- Long-term investment: The family home in Banilad has better appreciation potential and more rental stability for family tenants.\n\nWould you like me to suggest more properties with good investment potential in Cebu City?",
